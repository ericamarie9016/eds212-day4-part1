# Leslie Matrix Example

Model population changes

```{r}

# Could store vector of values separately and call into matrix
# Create matrix
insect_leslie <- matrix(c(0, 0, 600, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, .08, 0), 
                        nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
insect_leslie


```

## Add initial conditions

```{r}
insect_y0 <- c(12000, 700, 500)


```

## Multiply matrices

```{r}
insect_y1 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y0

insect_y1
```


## Estimate life stage for year 2

```{r}
insect_y2 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y1

insect_y2
```


## Estimate life stage for year 3
```{r}
insect_y3 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y2

insect_y3
```
